Important Information
üö® **Important Notice: API Request Limit Reached** üö®

Dear User,

We hope you're finding our SERP tool useful! üåê

To ensure a fair and reliable service for everyone, please be aware that we have a limit on the number of API requests you can make within a certain time frame. If you've received a CAPTCHA from Google, it means you've reached this limit.

Here's what you need to know:
- After a certain number of hits, your API requests may be temporarily blocked.
- This is a protective measure to prevent abuse and maintain service quality.
- To continue using the SERP tool, we recommend waiting for a bit before making additional requests.
